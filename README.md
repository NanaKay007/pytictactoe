# pytictactoe
Hi there! This is a tictactoe game I wrote myself. It has an AI component (which is a little smart and definitely does not make its choices by choosing randomly!). To run the code, you will need python installed and also have Zelle graphics placed in a directory where python can see it. This project is not complete yet, but I am continually working on it.
